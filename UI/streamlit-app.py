        ### üîç About This Application
        
        This application was developed as part of a **final-year academic project** to explore the use of **machine learning** and **real-time data analysis** in stock price prediction.  
        It integrates **financial market trends** and **sentiment analysis** to provide meaningful insights into potential stock movements.  

        ### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:
        - **Live news data** is analyzed to assess public sentiment and predict its impact on stock prices.  
        - **Live stock market data** is used to capture key fundamentals like opening price, volume, and trends.  
        - **Machine learning models** process this data to generate experimental stock price predictions.  

        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer:
        This application is purely for **academic and experimental purposes**.  
        Predictions made by the model are not guaranteed to be accurate‚Äî**machine learning models can make mistakes**.  
        This is **not a stock recommendation tool**. Investors should conduct their own research and consult a financial expert before making any investment decisions.
